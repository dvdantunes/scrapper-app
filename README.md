## Demo

You can see this engine in action through your browser on its [official endpoint](https://kanikumo-engine.herokuapp.com/)

Alternatively, you can request it through `curl`. For example:

    curl -s https://kanikumo-engine.herokuapp.com/ -v


## Quick Start




## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6
- Flask >= 1.0.2
- Flask-RESTful >= 0.3.6
- scrapy >= 1.5
- scrapy-splash >= 0.7.2

Some notes:

- This project built to be used with Python 3.6. Update `Makefile` to switch to another python version if needed

- Some Flask dependencies are compiled during installation, so `gcc` and Python header files need to be present.
For example, on Ubuntu:

    apt install build-essential python3-dev
